Quick port of Modest Maps (modestmaps.com) to Cinder Framework (libcinder.org)

It's pretty stable at this point on the github Cinder master (as of 2010-08-31) 
with Boost 1.44. 

Should work as a Cinder Block, you just need to set the CINDER_PATH in xcode.
(Not yet tested in Visual Studio)

Progress and early bugs discussed here:

Now supports multitouch, rotations and works on ipad (not battle tested yet).

I'd also like to be able to create textures in the background thread, the
creation of another OpenGL context for this seems promising:

See also http://github.com/randometc/modestmaps-of for OpenFrameworks for a 
comparison. It's quite a bit less complete than this version, however.
